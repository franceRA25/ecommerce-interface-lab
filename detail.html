I used this as a marine display to repeat my radar.
Solid construction. It has been expose to harsh rain and no issues. Don't over tighten the screw on the back input
and power cover because they have rubber washers. I'm super satisfied with this purchase.

The headphones are comfortable, not heavy, and don't run out of battery, but they crackle at high frequencies when connected to a computer or a phone, so it's impossible to listen to music loudly
